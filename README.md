# LiFEsTYLe

The LiFEsTYLe is a blog created using Ruby on Rails. I have made this a simple blog that allows creating categories, and under each category, we can add articles. Then, we can add comments and votes for each article. Besides, the home page has some filtration to show the featured article, which has the biggest number of votes, and each category will represent by the latest article added to it.
